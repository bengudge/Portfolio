                My name is Ben Gudgion and I am a web and software developer based in the Essex/London area.
                <br><br>
                Recently returning from seeing family and helping on the family business in rural
                Australia after graduating with a 2:1 in Computer Science and I am now pursuing work 
                in this industry. In that time, I made sure to continuously practise my programming skills 
                while also learning other technologies such as JavaScript, C#, Angular and NestJS etc.
                <br><br>
                I am a highly motivated individual with a thirst to continually learn and increase my knowledge 
                in a wide variety of aspects of the computer science field. Throughout my years at university
                and after, I have gained many skills in this field, not only in front-end development (HTML, CSS/SCSS,
                Angular, NestJS) but also back-end development (Java, C++, Python, MySQL, C#) and other areas like 
                Computer Vision, NLP, Security etc.
